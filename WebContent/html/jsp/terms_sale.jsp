Agreement contains the terms and conditions that apply to your ("Customer") 
purchase from Dell Financial Services L.P. ("DFS") for the used computer systems 
and/or related products ("Products") sold by DFS pursuant to this Agreement. By 
placing an order for the Products, Customer agrees to be bound by and accepts 
these terms and conditions.<strong> THESE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS APPLY UNLESS THE CUSTOMER HAS SIGNED A SEPARATE PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
WITH DFS FOR THE PURCHASE OF USED PRODUCTS, IN WHICH CASE THE SEPARATE AGREEMENT 
SHALL GOVERN.</strong> These terms and conditions are 
subject to change without prior written notice at any time, at DFS' sole 
discretion. </font></font></p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Products. ALL PRODUCTS SOLD BY DFS 
  PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT ARE USED, AND CONTAIN USED PARTS.</strong> 
  </font></font></div>

  <p></p>
  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Payment Terms; Orders; Late 
  Charges.</strong> Terms of payment are within DFS' sole discretion, and unless 
  otherwise agreed to by DFS, payment must be received by DFS prior to DFS' 
  acceptance of an order. Payment for the Products will be made by approved 
  credit card, check, wire transfer, or some other prearranged payment method 
  unless credit terms have been agreed to by DFS. Invoices are due and payable 
  within the time period noted on the invoice, measured from the date of the 
  invoice. Customer agrees to pay as a late charge, an amount equal to the 
  lesser of 1-1/2% per month or the highest rate allowed by law of the amount 
  then due until received by DFS. Orders are not binding upon DFS until accepted 
  by DFS.</font></font></div>

  <p></p>
  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Export.</strong> For the purposes 
  of this section, the use of 'export' shall mean the transfer of Products 
  outside of the continental United States. Customer acknowledges that the 
  exportation of Products is subject to compliance under the United States 
  Export Control Administration Act of 1979 and the Export Administration Act of 
  1985, as they may be amended from time to time, and the rules and regulations 
  promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Act"). If Customer exports the 
  Products, Customer agrees to comply with the terms and restrictions of the 
  Act, along with any antiboycott laws and regulations related to the Products. 
  Customer confirms that it will not unlawfully export or re-export the 
  Products, directly or indirectly, to (i) any countries that are subject to 
  U.S. export restrictions or (ii) any end user who has been prohibited from 
  participating in U.S. export transactions by any agency of the U.S. 
  government. Customer warrants that the Products will not be used to develop or 
  produce weapons of mass destruction or sold to an end user who, Customer knows 
  or has reason to know, may utilize the Products directly or indirectly in 
  connection with weapons of mass destruction or nuclear activities listed in 
  U.S. EAR 778.3(b)(1), (2) &amp; (3), whether or not the item is specifically 
  designed or modified for such activities. If Customer is not the ultimate end 
  user, Customer agrees to screen the reliability of each end user so that the 
  Products will not be used in a manner which is prohibited. Upon our request, 
  Customer agrees to execute, acknowledge, deliver and to cause to be duly filed 
  all such further instruments and documents and take actions as we may from 
  time to time reasonably request to assure that the necessary export 
  requirements have been met. If required, Customer will obtain prior 
  authorization for export of the Products in accordance with the Export 
  Administration Regulations of the Department of Commerce. If applicable, 
  Customer will be responsible for assuring that the appropriate import permits 
  and licenses with respect to the Products, including any markings needed for 
  import are obtained. Customer shall indemnify and hold DFS harmless against 
  any claims, damages or losses incurred as a result of Customer's failure to 
  comply with the Act or terms contained herein. DFS reserves the right to 
  terminate any sale if Customer fails to comply with the Act or the terms 
  contained herein. </font></font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Software.</strong> DFS has no 
  right, title, or interest in any software that may be contained in or a part 
  of the Products. Title to software will remain with the applicable 
  licensor(s). Any rights that Customer may have with respect to the software 
  shall arise only pursuant to license agreements ("Licenses") between Customer 
  and the licensor(s), which Licenses may be contained within the packaging 
  associated with the Products. Customer agrees to use all software in 
  accordance with the Licenses. </font></font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Warranties.</strong> Some Products 
  offered by DFS may be covered by a warranty provided in writing by the

  DFS assigns to Customer any such remaining warranty provided by the 
  manufacturer. <strong>PRODUCTS ARE SOLD ON AN "AS-IS, WHERE IS"BASIS. DFS 
  DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT 
  LIMITATION IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MECHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
  PURPOSE</strong>. DFS does not warrant any software under this Agreement. 
  Warranties, if any, for the software are contained in the license agreement 
  that governs its purchase and use. </font></font></div>

  <div><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><strong>Arbitration.</strong> Either 
  party to this Agreement may choose to have any dispute, claim or controversy 
  arising from or relating to this Agreement resolved by binding arbitration 
  pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration 
  Association. If such rules conflict with this arbitration agreement section, 
  however, then the terms of this arbitration agreement section shall control. 
  This arbitration agreement between Customer and DFS is made pursuant to a 
  transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the 
  Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. Judgment upon the award 
  rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Any arbitration 
  award in excess of $100,000 made pursuant to this arbitration agreement 
  section may be appealed by the party against which the award is made. Such 
  appeal will be a de novo arbitration proceeding before three arbitrators. The 
  parties agree and understand that (i) they may choose arbitration instead of 
  litigation to resolve disputes, (ii) all disputes arising under case law, 
  statutory law, and all other laws including, but not limited to, all contract, 
  tort, and property disputes, may be subject to binding arbitration in accord 
  with this Agreement and (iii) the arbitrator shall have all powers provided by 
  law and this Agreement, except for powers limited or prohibited by this 
  Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have any authority however, to award 
  damages or penalties in contravention to the provisions of this Agreement. No 
  class action or request for relief may be brought under this arbitration 
  agreement. Customer agrees that it shall not have the right to participate in 
  arbitration or in court proceedings as a representative or a member of any 
  class of claimants pertaining to any claim arising from or relating to this 
  Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, we retain an 
  option to use judicial or non-judicial relief to recover the Products or to 
  enforce our security interest in the Products, to enforce the monetary 
  obligation secured by the Products or to foreclose on the Products. Such 
  judicial relief would take the form of a lawsuit. The institution and 
  maintenance of any action for judicial relief in a court to foreclose upon any 
  Products, to obtain a monetary judgment or to enforce this Agreement, shall 
  not constitute a waiver of the right of any party to compel arbitration 
  regarding any other dispute or remedy subject to arbitration in this 
  Agreement, including the filing of a counterclaim in a suit brought by DFS 
  pursuant to this provision. <strong>CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT IN 
  ARBITRATION: YOU GIVE UP RIGHTS TO SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT 
  TO A JURY TRIAL; YOUR ABILITY TO COMPEL OTHER PARTIES TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS OR 
  BE EXAMINED IS MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT; AND, YOUR RIGHTS TO APPEAL OR 
  CHANGE ANY ARBITRATION AWARD IN ANY COURT ARE STRICTLY LIMITED.</strong>
